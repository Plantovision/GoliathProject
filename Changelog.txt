"added the chopping block."
Fixed a bug that would cause green sparks when move particles were supposed to despawn.
Fixed a bug that stopped middle click from deselecting units and forts.
Replaced gold with silver in order to prevent confusion between ores and yellow units.
Fixed an issue with units floating slightly off the ground
Added miners
Changed purple team to blue team.
Silver ores are now (partially) functional.
   - Miners can mine from them and bring the silver to deposits, but there is no system for giving silver to teams or designating which team owns which deposit.
Added deposits, which are currently non-functional
Spawn times have been reduced to near zero, for the sake of testing.
